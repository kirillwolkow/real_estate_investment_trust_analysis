# real_estate_investment_trust_analysis

Hello fellow developers. I'm a student of Codecademy and I just finished the Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis Project from the 'Visualize Financial Data with Python' Skill Course.

I'm here to share this project to receive feedback from you!

How to setup:
- Download all files and store them in a single folder
- Open CMD, GitBash or another prompt
- Direct to the folder
- Open with jupyter with this command: jupyter notebook
- Open the file "real_estate_investment_trust_analysis_kirillwolkow"

In this file you find my code. In the other two files you find the instructions and the solution.

My Questions:
1. What is the difference between "np.loadtxt" and "np.genfromtxt"?
2. Is there a more elegant way to write the code?
3. I'm not this skilled in mathematics, is there a good book/course/video to learn mathematics for Financial Data Analysis?

I'M OPEN FOR EVERY FEEDBACK!

You can reach me on my website: https://kirillwolkow.github.io/
